# GPSD to MQTT

![gpsd logo](gpsd2mqtt/logo.png)

This is a [gpsd â€” a GPS service daemon](https://gpsd.gitlab.io/gpsd/) to MQTT Home Assistant Addon.

My plan is to dynamically update my boats location in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), but first GPSD data input was required! 

Basically this addon grabs the gpsd data from the configured serial port and publishes it to a MQTT broker (for instance [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/))

## Installation
