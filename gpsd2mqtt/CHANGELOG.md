# Changelog

## [2024.9.0] - 2024-09-03
 - Added optional debug logging to check if all attributes received gets published to MQTT
 - Added logic to make sure attributes track and magtrack does not expire in Home Assistant even if not reported for an extended period, this can happen if the GPS is stationary
 - Merged upstream PR changes (builder)
 - Change to fix that disabling the interval for publishing updates defaulted to 10 (setting config option to 0)

## [2024.7.0] - 2024-07-25
 - Changes done to Apparmor to fix permissions error causing problem for certain USB GPS devices
 - Removed settings for sock, should not be needed
 
## [2024.4.4] - 2024-05-28
 - Reworked changes that broke republishing of MQTT devices after HA reboot

## [2024.4.3] - 2024-05-26
 - Small fixes

## [2024.4.2] - 2024-04-17
 - Added option to configure required number of satellites to establish the position. 3D fix is 3 satellites, but sometimes you need a more accurate position rather than frequent updates. Setting this to 5, or even 6 or 7 will greatly increase the accuracy of the position reported to device_tracker. Note that the updated position frequency could be reduced if the GPS sensor has bad coverage, especially the first minutes after the add-on is started. You will then get 0 new updates in the log, but be patient and it will start reporting if the coverage is good enough
 - Introduced a new sensor for Sky data. Under Settings -> Integrations -> Entities (MQTT) -> GPSD Service. This device shows the Sky coverage data as attributes. The sensor is called sensor.gpsd_service_sky_data and the state is the current number of satellites used to establish position

## [2024.4.1] - 2024-04-10
 - NEW OPTION: No username or password required for MQTT if using Mosquitto on Home Assistant. If you use custom username / password this can be deleted if the previous is true
 - NEW OPTION: Add option to only publish when good GPS fix is achieved, and made it default. Option called "3D Fix Only". Turn it off if you like to get all updates
 - Fix the configurable publish interval setting. This is 10 seconds default, can be changed in options, set to 0 to publish all updates. Did not work in previous releases
 - Many small fixes and improvements


## [2024.4.0] - 2024-04-01
