  input_type:
    name: Device type 
    description: Select serial for most use cases, like direct attached gps dongle via USB or similar. Optional select TCP for network connected devices, make sure to fill inn TCP Host and TCP Port below and set device to a dummy serial device (not used, any serial device would work).
